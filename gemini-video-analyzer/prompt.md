## 1. Executive Summary

The exponential growth of online video content presents a significant challenge for users attempting to quickly find relevant information or understand a video's core content without investing significant time watching. Traditional metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) is often insufficient, misleading, or manually generated.

The AI Video Analysis Platform is a web application designed to solve this problem by leveraging advanced AI (multimodal analysis) to automatically extract deep, nuanced insights ("hidden information") from video content. These insights include topics, mood, key moments, objects, and category-specific data. The platform will present this complex analytical data through intuitive visualizations like smart thumbnail overlays and interactive hover previews, enabling users to efficiently assess video relevance and understand key details at a glance, saving valuable time and improving discovery.

Initial focus will be on supporting specific video categories (starting with Cooking), with a technical foundation built for scalability and extensibility.

## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Automatic Multimodal Analysis

*   **Description:** The core engine that processes videos to extract hidden insights by analyzing transcripts (text), visual content (computer vision), and audio cues using integrated AI models (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and data APIs (Supadata API).
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want the platform to automatically analyze videos I search for or browse so that I can see deep insights about their content.
    *   As a user, I want the analysis to go beyond titles and descriptions, using AI to understand what's actually shown and said in the video.
    *   As a user, I want the platform to combine information from speech, visuals, and sounds so that the analysis is comprehensive.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system shall successfully queue a video for analysis when it is accessed (e.g., displayed in search results).
    *   The system shall retrieve video metadata (title, description, URL, duration, thumbnail) using SerpAPI (or similar YouTube Data API).
    *   The system shall retrieve the video transcript if available via SerpAPI.
    *   The system shall use Gemini 2.5 Pro (or equivalent) to perform analysis on the transcript, extracting keywords, topics, sentiment, and potential key moments.
    *   The system shall perform visual analysis (e.g., object detection, scene recognition) on key frames extracted from the video (mechanism for frame extraction TBD, potentially via external service or processing video file directly if feasible/allowed).
    *   The system shall perform audio analysis (e.g., identifying music, sound effects, tone changes) on the video audio track.
    *   The system shall use the Supadata API (as specified in input, purpose to be confirmed - assuming it adds contextual data or enhances analysis) to enrich or validate findings.
    *   The system shall consolidate the results from text, visual, and audio analysis into a structured data format.
    *   The system shall infer the primary category of the video (e.g., Cooking, Fitness) based on the analysis results.
    *   The system shall store the structured analysis results linked to the video ID in the database.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Video has no transcript.
    *   Video is private, region-restricted, or deleted.
    *   External API (SerpAPI, Gemini, Supadata) request fails or times out.
    *   Video content is non-standard (e.g., static image with audio, purely music, abstract visuals).
    *   Analysis identifies potentially sensitive or offensive content (needs flagging mechanism).
    *   Very long videos causing excessive processing time or API costs.
    *   Video language is not supported by transcript extraction or AI models.

### 4.2 User-Friendly Visualizations

#### 4.2.1 Smart Thumbnail Overlays

*   **Description:** Display concise visual indicators and/or brief text snippets derived from the analysis directly on video thumbnails in browse/search results.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user browsing search results, I want to see quick visual cues on thumbnails so I can instantly tell if a video is potentially relevant.
    *   As a user, I want to see icons or short labels indicating key aspects like the video's main topic or category without needing to read the title carefully.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   For videos with available analysis, the system shall generate up to 3 concise visual elements (icons, short text labels) based on the highest-confidence analysis results (e.g., primary category icon, top topic keyword, estimated difficulty).
    *   These visual elements shall be displayed as an overlay on the video thumbnail within the search and browse results views.
    *   The overlays shall be positioned so they do not obscure the most critical part of the thumbnail image.
    *   The design of the overlays shall be intuitive and easily scannable.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   No analysis data is available for a video.
    *   Automatically generated labels are too long to fit or are nonsensical.
    *   Thumbnail image contrast makes overlays hard to see.

#### 4.2.2 Interactive Previews (Hover)

*   **Description:** When a user hovers over a video thumbnail, a small, fast-loading preview panel appears displaying more detailed, category-specific analysis highlights.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, when I'm considering a video, I want to quickly get more details by just hovering over its thumbnail.
    *   As a user, I want the hover preview to show me information specific to the video's category (e.g., ingredients for cooking, exercises for fitness).
    *   As a user, I want the hover preview to load instantly so it doesn't interrupt my browsing flow.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   When a user hovers their mouse cursor over a video thumbnail for more than `N` milliseconds (e.g., 300ms), a preview panel shall appear adjacent to the thumbnail.
    *   The preview panel shall display key analysis results relevant to the video's identified category (e.g., for Cooking: key ingredients identified; for Fitness: type of workout, body parts; for Tech: product name, key features discussed). The specific data points displayed will be defined per category.
    *   The analysis data for the preview shall be loaded from a fast cache layer (see Feature 4).
    *   The preview panel shall disappear when the user's cursor leaves the thumbnail area.
    *   The information presented in the preview panel shall be concise and easy to read.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Analysis data for the video is not yet available or not in the cache.
    *   User is on a touch device (hover interaction is not applicable - design needs a fallback or disabled state).
    *   The analysis did not yield specific data points for the video's identified category.
    *   The preview panel obscures other content or goes off-screen on smaller displays.

### 4.3 Multi-Category Support

    *   The Interactive Preview (Feature 4.2.2) shall display data points defined specifically for the video's identified category.
    *   The UI shall allow users to filter search/browse results by supported categories.
    *   Initial supported category: Cooking.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Video fits into multiple categories (e.g., "Cooking for Fitness"). System needs a primary category assignment.
    *   Analysis fails to confidently determine a category.
    *   Video belongs to a category not currently supported (fallback to general analysis).
    *   Category-specific analysis fails even if a category is identified.

### 4.4 Performance & Reliability

*   **Description:** Implement technical strategies to ensure the platform is fast and robust, particularly for retrieving analysis data.
*   **User Stories:**

    *   As a user, I want the platform to work reliably, even if external services occasionally have issues.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A multi-level caching strategy shall be implemented for storing and retrieving analysis results (at least for summaries and preview data).
    *   Hover previews (Feature 4.2.2) shall retrieve data from the cache to ensure near-instant display.
    *   The system shall implement retry mechanisms for external API calls (SerpAPI, Gemini, Supadata).
    *   The system shall implement fallback mechanisms (graceful degradation) if an external API fails (e.g., display basic video info even if analysis isn't available, show cached analysis if real-time update fails).
    *   Analysis processing shall be designed to run asynchronously, not blocking UI responsiveness.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Cache invalidation logic fails, showing stale data.
    *   Cache is cold (e.g., first time a video is accessed), resulting in slower initial load.
    *   Complete outage of a critical external API without a viable fallback.
    *   Analysis task queue backs up, delaying results for new videos.

### 4.5 Simple UI (Search, Browse, Filter)

*   **Description:** A clean and intuitive user interface for finding and exploring videos based on their extracted analysis data.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to search for videos using keywords related to their actual content, not just titles.
    *   As a user, I want to filter videos based on the insights the AI found (e.g., only show videos discussing 'chocolate chips', or categorized as 'Fitness').
    *   As a user, I want to easily browse through relevant videos and quickly scan their key details.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The search bar shall query against video metadata (title, description) *and* the extracted analysis results (keywords, topics, identified objects/ingredients/etc.).
    *   A dedicated section or panel shall provide filtering options based on the extracted analysis data (e.g., Category, Key Topics/Keywords, potentially Sentiment/Mood if analyzed).
    *   The main view shall display video thumbnails with the Smart Thumbnail Overlays (Feature 4.2.1).
    *   Clicking on a video thumbnail or title shall lead to a dedicated video detail page (scope of detail page TBD for V1, but basic link is needed).
    *   The interface shall be responsive and work on standard desktop browser sizes.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Search queries containing terms not found in analysis or metadata yield no results.
    *   Applying multiple filters results in zero matching videos.
    *   Search/filter performance degrades significantly with a large number of analyzed videos.
    *   UI elements are confusing or not easily discoverable.
